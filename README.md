# Ampere
Ampere is an application that aims to provide laptop battery life and health information to a user in a neat GUI. 
The goal is to make the battery life predictions much more accurate relative to the default Windows battery tool while 
also trying to estimate the health condition of the battery based on its charging and discharging behavior. It will 
also be able to give voice and visual alerts to a user about overcharge or overdischarge conditions.

Anyone is free to download and use this application as they wish personally, but if you intend to modify 
and re-publish it, you must cite this GitHub page as this is where the original project lies.
