# Ampere
Ampere is an application that aims to provide laptop battery life and health information to a user in a neat GUI. 
The goal is to provide more in depth details compared to the default Windows battery tool which is only available in 
Windows PowerShell while also trying to estimate the health condition of the battery based on its charging and discharging behavior. 
It will also be able to give voice and visual alerts to a user about overcharge or overdischarge conditions.
